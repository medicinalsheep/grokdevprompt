# GrokDevPrompt v0.1

**Craft powerful, spec-driven prompts for Grok** — perfect for building games, apps, tools, AI experiments, blockchain projects, VR/AR experiences, Unity/Unreal games, mods, and more.

A simple, beautiful, single-file HTML tool that helps you generate extremely detailed, production-ready development prompts tailored for Grok (xAI).

Designed for both beginners who want quick results and advanced prompt engineers who love to push boundaries with iterative, self-improving, and multi-part prompt experiments.

## Features

- Clean dark cyberpunk-style interface
- 15+ project types (Web, Mobile, Unity, Unreal, VR/AR, AI/ML, Blockchain, Game Mods, Steam integration, etc.)
- 25+ common feature checkboxes (multiplayer, AI integration, procedural generation, Steamworks, mod support, 4K graphics, monetization, cloud sync...)
- Custom feature input
- Tech stack & non-functional requirements specification
- **Experimental features**:
  - Truncate / multi-response mode (perfect for very large projects)
  - **Prompt self-improvement loop** — Grok generates an improved version of this very tool with more targeted questions
- One-click copy to clipboard
- Fully responsive — works great on mobile & desktop
- Zero dependencies — pure HTML/CSS/JS

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (or host it anywhere)
2. Fill in your project details
3. Select features & experimental options if desired
4. Click **Generate Grok Prompt**
5. Copy the result and paste it directly to Grok

## Experimental Features Warning

> **You might go down the rabbit hole!**  
> The experimental checkboxes can lead to very long conversations, recursive prompt engineering, and surprisingly powerful self-evolving tools.

## Development

This project is itself a great playground for prompt engineering experiments.

Want to improve GrokDevPrompt itself?  
Check the **"Prompt self-improvement loop"** experimental feature — it will ask Grok to generate the next version of this tool with more specific questions for your project type.
