# GrokDevPrompt v0.2

**Spec-driven prompt generator for Grok**  
Build anything — games (Unity, Unreal, Three.js), apps (web, mobile, desktop), AI tools, blockchain dApps, VR/AR experiences, game mods, Steam-integrated projects — with extremely detailed, production-ready prompts.

A beautiful, single-file HTML tool designed to help you craft insanely powerful prompts for Grok (xAI).  
Perfect for beginners who want fast results and advanced prompt engineers who love recursive, self-evolving prompt experiments.

## Core Features

- Dark cyberpunk aesthetic (zero external dependencies)
- 15+ project types (Web, Mobile, Unity, Unreal, VR/AR, AI/ML, Blockchain, Game Mods, Steamworks, IoT, CLI, API…)
- 25+ common feature checkboxes (multiplayer, procedural generation, AI integration, Steam achievements, mod support, 4K graphics, monetization, cloud sync…)
- Custom features (one per line)
- Tech stack, non-functional requirements & additional instructions
- One-click prompt generation + copy to clipboard
- Fully responsive — mobile & desktop
- **Experimental features** (rabbit hole warning ⚠️):
  - Truncate / multi-response mode (great for huge projects)
  - **Prompt self-improvement loop** — lets Grok evolve this very tool with more targeted questions, recommendations, side-effect warnings, and now **theme control**

## New in v0.2 — Self-Improvement Evolution

When you check **"Prompt self-improvement loop"**:

- Grok generates an improved version of the tool (v0.2+) specialized to your current project
- Adds **project-specific checkboxes** with benefit + side-effect tooltips
- Shows **contextual recommendations/guidance** panel
- Keeps the self-improvement checkbox **pre-checked** by default (loop continues until you uncheck it)
- **New field**: "Desired visual theme / style / color scheme for the final product"  
  → Prevents forcing the dark cyberpunk look onto your generated projects unless you want it  
  → Examples: neon vaporwave, clean corporate light, retro 8-bit, high-contrast accessibility, etc.  
  → Smart detection: if your current inputs already hint at a theme, it suggests a pre-fill value

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in any browser (or host it on GitHub Pages)
2. Fill in your project basics, features, tech, etc.
3. (Optional) Enable experimental features
4. Click **Generate Grok Prompt**
5. Copy → paste directly into Grok

Want an even better generator for your specific project?  
Check **Prompt self-improvement loop**, generate, save the new HTML, open it, and repeat — each iteration gets smarter.
