# GrokDevPrompt v0.3

**Spec-driven prompt generator for Grok**  
Create insanely detailed, production-ready development prompts for **anything**:  
Unity/Unreal games, web/mobile/desktop apps, AI tools, blockchain dApps, VR/AR experiences, game mods, Steam-integrated projects, procedural worlds, and beyond.

Single-file HTML tool — beautiful dark cyberpunk interface, zero dependencies, fully responsive.

Perfect for beginners wanting quick quality results and advanced users who enjoy **limitless recursive prompt engineering experiments**.

## Core Features

- 15+ project types (Web, Mobile, Unity, Unreal, VR/AR, AI/ML, Blockchain, Game Mods, Steamworks…)
- 25+ common feature checkboxes (multiplayer, procedural gen, Steam achievements, mod support, 4K, AI integration, monetization…)
- Custom features input
- Tech stack, non-functional requirements & additional instructions
- One-click copy-to-clipboard prompt generation
- **Experimental features** (⚠️ rabbit hole territory):
  - Truncate / multi-response mode (ideal for very large/complex projects)
  - **Prompt self-improvement loop** — lets Grok evolve this very tool iteratively, getting smarter and more specific with each cycle

## Self-Improvement Loop (v0.3 highlights)

When you enable **"Prompt self-improvement loop"**:

- Produces a **new specialized version** of the generator tailored to your current project
- Tracks **iteration number** (#1 → #2 → #3…) so you know how deep you are
- Shows **"not yet specified"** for empty fields instead of "none"
- Adds project-specific feature checkboxes + benefit/side-effect tooltips
- Shows contextual recommendations/guidance panel
- Includes new optional field: **Desired visual theme/style/color scheme** for the final product  
  (prevents forcing dark cyberpunk look onto every project unless you want it)
- Keeps the self-improvement checkbox **pre-checked by default** — loop continues until you manually disable it
- When truncate mode is active → uses clean multi-part response instructions without conflicting "do not truncate"

→ Each generated version remains visually identical (same dark cyberpunk style) but becomes more intelligent about **your project**.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` (or use the live version: https://medicinalsheep.github.io/grokdevprompt/)
2. Describe your project & select features
3. (Optional) Enable experimental features
4. Click **Generate Grok Prompt**
5. Copy → paste to Grok

Want a generator that’s hyper-specialized to **your exact project**?  
Enable the self-improvement loop, generate, save the new HTML, open it, repeat.  
Watch it evolve. 🌀
